              Education in all different forms is key to breaking the cycle of
              poverty. It has an uplifting effect on other aspects of society
              that may seem totally unrelated, such as girls’ education lowering
              the number of prenatal deaths. The relationship between poverty
              and education is complex, but we know that education helps people
              make healthier and smarter decisions about their children, their
              livelihoods and the way they live. Education also has a
              significant role in the fight for children’s rights, both in
              teaching children what they can and should expect from adults, and
              in showing adults the benefits of respecting their children’s
              rights.

              Education designed to support early development in preparation for
              participation in school and society. The programmes are designed
              for children below the age of three. This is ISCED level 01.[59]
              Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to
              seven, depending on the country when children enter primary
              education. The children now readily interact with their peers and
              the educator.[59] These are also known as nursery schools and as
              kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers
              to the earliest levels of primary education.

              Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving
              access to education for people living in impoverished areas and
              developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement
              is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to
              education in developing countries.[113] Charities like One Laptop
              per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which
              the disadvantaged may access educational materials.
